## Project goals

_This project aims to develop [R/Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) 
tools to analyze AMR data by integrating publicly available human gut 
metagenomes with ARG profiles (e.g. 
[metagenomics](https://www.nature.com/subjects/metagenomics)) and 
epidemiological, transmission data to study AMR gene co-migration._


## Approach
Reproducible data science workflow and dissemination material to demonstrate the 
utilization of the latest Bioconductor multi-assay data integration framework in 
the context of resistome profiling in large population studies. This covers 
dedicated data structures and the complementary data analysis and visualization 
methods. The outcomes are reported via an automated pkgdown website.

[Standout presentation](/standouts/standout-day1.odp)

## Analysis plan
1. _Prepare data_ 
      * Prepare the [Lee et al. (2023)](https://github.com/microbiome/data/tree/main/Lee2023) 
      dataset for analysis in R/Bioc. See [data summary](https://ncbi-codeathons.github.io/amr-2024-team-lahti/articles/data_summary.html).
      * Link the dataset to the [NDARO database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/antimicrobial-resistance/) 
      on microbial organisms and resistance genes.

2. _Prepare documentation_
      * Create minimal website for this project.
      * Prepare summary of the dataset.
      * Create tutorials on resistome data analysis.
      * To add documents to the minimal website, see [technical guide](https://ncbi-codeathons.github.io/amr-2024-team-lahti/articles/addqmd.html)
  
3. _Analyse the resistome data set_
      * Provide exploratory summaries of the dataset using R/Bioc methods.
      * Replicate some key results from the [manuscript](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36633-7) to verify the data.
  
4. _Develop methodology_
      * Implement visualization methods as functions.
    
5. _Finalize workflow_
      * Polish the data analysis workflow/s & documentation.

## Results
The main outcome of this work is the reproducible project site including data 
science workflows for resistome analysis. This forms the basis for an extendable 
collection of resistome analysis workflows for reanalysis of data for new 
discoveries, methods development and educational purposes.

## Future work
Future work will standardize and automate some of the key tools, and release 
them through open source software libraries such as 
_[mia](https://microbiome.github.io/mia/)_ in R/Bioconductor.
