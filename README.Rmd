## Team roles

* _Team Lead / Leo (antagomir)_
Conveys scientific objectives to the team, and coordinates work.

* _Tech Lead / Jeba (ake123) & Muluh (Daenarys8)_
Coordinates software installation and data acquisition, manages version control and the teamâ€™s GitHub repository, troubleshoots technical issues with tech support

* _Writer / Datta (microDM), Nitin (nixonbyl)_
Ensures that all work is documented, manages GitHub README and Team Report

* _Flex / Mahkameh (mahkamehsalehi), Shivang (ShivangPB)_
Fills various roles and assumes responsibilities for tasks as needed

## Project Goals

* Prepare the Lee et al. (2023) data set for analysis in R/Bioc and provide sufficient documentation in the Github repository. 

* Create minimal website for this project using pkgdown 
* Prepare summary of the data set to be presented on a slide set

* Create tutorial on resistome data analysis using the latest R/Bioconductor methods and release them via the Github repository (vignettes/ subfolder)

* Provide exploratory summaries of the data set using R/Bioc methods

* Replicate of some key results from the manuscript using R/Bioconductor methods to verify the data

* Consider automation of specific analysis or visualization methods as functions that can be share via new R pkg, or existing packages

* Polish the data analysis workflow/s & documentation so that they can be used as training material on resistome analyses using R/Bioconductor
