## Team roles

- **Team Lead** / [Leo Lahti](https://github.com/antagomir) Conveys
  scientific objectives to the team, and coordinates work.

- **Tech Lead** / [Akewak Jeba](https://github.com/ake123) & [Muluh
  Geraldson](https://github.com/Daenarys8) Coordinates software
  installation and data acquisition, manages version control and the
  teamâ€™s GitHub repository, troubleshoots technical issues with tech
  support

- **Writer** / [Dattaray Mongad](https://github.com/microDM) & [Nitin
  Bayal](https://github.com/nixonbyl) Ensures that all work is
  documented, manages GitHub README and Team Report

- **Flex** / [Mahkameh Salehi](https://github.com/mahkamehsalehi) &
  [Shivang](https://github.com/ShivangPB) Fills various roles and
  assumes responsibilities for tasks as needed

## Project Goals

*This project aims to develop
[R/Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) tools to analyze AMR
data by integrating publicly available human gut metagenomes with ARG
profiles (e.g.,
[metagenomics](https://www.nature.com/subjects/metagenomics)) and
epidemiological, transmission data to study AMR gene co-migration.*

## Approach

Reproducible data science workflow and dissemination material to
demonstrate the utilization of the latest Bioconductor multi-assay data
integration framework in the context of resistome profiling in large
population studies. This covers dedicated data structures and the
complementary data analysis and visualization methods. The outcomes are
reported via an automated pkgdown website.

## Results

The main outcome of this work is the reproducible project site including
data science workflows for resistome analysis. This forms the basis for
an extendable collection of resistome analysis workflows for reanalysis
of data for new discoveries, methods development and educational
purposes.

## Future Work

Future work will standardize and automate some of the key tools, and
release them through open source software libraries such as
*[mia](https://microbiome.github.io/mia/)* in R/Bioconductor.

## NCBI Codeathon Disclaimer

This software was created as part of an NCBI codeathon(See
[details](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/ncbi/workshops/2024-09_AMR-Codeathon/codeathon-details.html))
, a hackathon-style event focused on rapid innovation. While we
encourage you to explore and adapt this code, please be aware that NCBI
does not provide ongoing support for it.
