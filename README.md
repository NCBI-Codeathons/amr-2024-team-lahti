## Team roles

- *Team Lead / Leo (antagomir)* Conveys scientific objectives to the
  team, and coordinates work.

- *Tech Lead / Jeba (ake123) & Muluh (Daenarys8)* Coordinates software
  installation and data acquisition, manages version control and the
  team’s GitHub repository, troubleshoots technical issues with tech
  support

- *Writer / Datta (microDM), Nitin (nixonbyl)* Ensures that all work is
  documented, manages GitHub README and Team Report

- *Flex / Mahkameh (mahkamehsalehi), Shivang (ShivangPB)* Fills various
  roles and assumes responsibilities for tasks as needed

## Project Goals

- Prepare the Lee et al. (2023) data set for analysis in R/Bioc and
  provide sufficient documentation in the Github repository.

- Create minimal website for this project using pkgdown

- Prepare summary of the data set to be presented on a slide set

- Create tutorial on resistome data analysis using the latest
  R/Bioconductor methods and release them via the Github repository
  (vignettes/ subfolder)

- Provide exploratory summaries of the data set using R/Bioc methods

- Replicate of some key results from the manuscript using R/Bioconductor
  methods to verify the data

- Consider automation of specific analysis or visualization methods as
  functions that can be share via new R pkg, or existing packages

- Polish the data analysis workflow/s & documentation so that they can
  be used as training material on resistome analyses using
  R/Bioconductor
