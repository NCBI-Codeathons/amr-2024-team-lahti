# Overview

This vignette serves as a technical guide for integrating new Quarto documents 
into the package website. The process includes adding `.qmd` files, updating 
configurations, and rendering the site. This workflow ensures that new 
documentation (including articles, summaries, and presentations) is properly 
displayed on the website.

## Prerequisites

- The main script for rendering the Quarto documents is located in the `slides` 
directory, under the filename `main.R`.
- You will need the `pkgdown` package installed to locally build and test the site.
```{code}
install.packages("pkgdown")
```

## Adding a New Document

### Step 1: Place the `.qmd` File in the `slides` Directory

To add a new document to the website, first, ensure that the Quarto file (`.qmd`) 
is placed in the `slides` directory. This directory houses all the source files 
for the site's content.

### Step 2: Edit the `_quarto.yml` File

After adding the `.qmd` file, navigate to the `_quarto.yml` file found in the 
`slides` directory. You need to add the new file to the YAML configuration so 
that it can be included in the site.

1. Open `_quarto.yml` in a text editor.
2. Locate the section listing the documents to be rendered.
3. Add the filename of the new `.qmd` file to the list. Hereâ€™s an example:

```{code}
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: ../docs/articles
  render:
    - data_summary.qmd
    - standout_presentation.qmd
    - standout_transcripts.qmd
```

### Step 3: Run the `main.R` Script

Once the `.qmd` file is added to the configuration, run the `main.R` script f
ound in the `slides` directory to render the document and update the website files.

```{code}
# In R
source("slides/main.R")
```


This script will create the necessary web files for the site in the `docs/articles` 
subdirectory.

## Adding a Document to a Submenu

To organize the document under a specific section (e.g., "Articles" or "Methods"),
you will need to edit the `_pkgdown.yml` file located in the root directory.

1. Open `_pkgdown.yml` in your code editor.
2. Locate the section under "Articles" or the relevant submenu.
3. Add an entry for the new file, similar to how existing documents are organized:

```{code}
title: teamlahti
url: https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/amr-2024-team-lahti
template:
  params:
    bootswatch: flatly
    ganalytics: UA-84499524-2
reference:
  - title: Exported Functions
    desc: ~
  - title: Internals
    desc: ~
navbar:
  type: inverse
  left:
    - icon: fa-home
      href: articles/index.html
  right:
    - text: "Articles"
      icon: fas fa-book
      menu:
      -  text: Installation
         href: https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/amr-2024-team-lahti
      -  text: Data summary
         href: articles/data_summary.html
      -  text: Presentation 9.24.24
```
### Step 4: Build the Site Locally

Once the necessary changes are made, run `build_site()` from the console to test 
the site locally:

```{code}
pkgdown::build_site()
```

This command will render the site in your local environment so you can review 
the changes before pushing them to the repository.

## Final Step: Commit and Push Changes

If everything looks good, commit your changes and push them to the remote 
repository:
```{code}
git add .
git commit -m "Added new quarto document to site"
git push origin main
```

Once the changes are pushed, the new document should be live on the site after 
the deployment process completes.
